**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

The difference between Git and Github is that Git is a tool to track many things such as changes to code and collaborating with others. Github is where the Gits are stored online. This making it easy for people to collaberate on projects with each other and keep a record of the project's history.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing and pushing is how changes made from a local machine like a computor are added to a repository in GitHub's system and allows instructors and teammates to see your work when you want them to. You can commit something when changes are made to a project that you would want to be a checkpoint in your progress.  A push command adds all the changes to a remote repository.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is a project folder where all work done on a project happens. It contains all of the project's files and a history of every edit made to a project.
