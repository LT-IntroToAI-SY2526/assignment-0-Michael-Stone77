## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

The difference between Git and Github is that Git is a tool to track many things such as changes to code and collaborating with others. Github is where the Gits are stored online. This making it easy for people to collaberate on projects with each other and keep a record of the project's history.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing and pushing are important because it is how changes made from a local machine like a computor are added to a repository in GitHub's system and allows instructors and teammates to see your work when you want them to. You can commit something when changes are made to a project that you would want to be a checkpoint in your progress.  A push command adds all the changes to a remote repository and saves it to the project.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is a project folder where all work done on a project happens. It contains all of the project's files and a history of every edit made to a project.

## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

The aspects of AI I am most excited to learn about this year is AI's reasoning and perception.  With the reasoning, I would want to know more about how it is able to reason, what is coded or put into the AI that gives it it's ability to reason? I would also want to know if AI's reasoning can change as time goes on, is it able to develop a concious and even become self aware or are there limiters or blockers that stop this from happening?  With the perception, I would like to know what it percepts, is it similar to our own perception as humans since we made them or does AIs percept things differently then we do. If they do percept things differently, what causes this differening perception, are there certain things that cause it or can it just be different by chance?  Overall, these are two of the aspects of AI I am most excited to learn about as these are the two aspects I have the most questions about.
